## Something that I have found interesting: 

<h4>Utilizing the Inspector for good and evil >:] </h4>

The goods: Development

I had known of the inspector for quite some time before beginning to learn how to code. But looking at it then (and even now sometimes) it did not look very inviting, so I ignored it. Fastforwarding a few weeks into class, I have been able to see how powerful a tool it can be. And it is constantly evolving. With features like the device emulator and the color palette picker being added to aid us further in developing responsive pages more quickly, it is always proving to be a useful tool. Also, upon inspecting the inspector, you will find all kinds of tools and features built into it that you probably will never use; a sign of how versatile it can be.

The bads: Free Internet (stickin'-it to The Man)

This is something that we have learned in class: the fact that we can manipulate anyone's page in almost any fashion. Which can all be in good fun, but I have recently found myself bypassing some website's prerequisites-of-perusing their site <strong>(i.e. deleting pop-up banners (no thank you Pinterest))</strong> in order to gain access to its contents. Sometimes, I <em>almost</em> feel bad, but then I don't.
